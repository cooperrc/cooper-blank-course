This repository holds starter files to build a course website using:
- [Jupter-Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html)
- [GitHub-Pages](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/publish.html#publish-your-book-online-with-github-pages)
- [GitHub actions](https://github.com/features/actions)

Jupyter-Book handles the conversion of markdown and Jupyter notebooks to
html web pages. 

GitHub-pages creates a URL and serves your HTML website.

GitHub actions updates the website each time a new commit is pushed to
`main`.
